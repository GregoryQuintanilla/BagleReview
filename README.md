# BagleReview

This is the Begel Tawk Y'all, a rag tag team of the finest candidates from their respective states going around and trying the bagels this hunk of dirt has to offer. We have started out jounry on the garbage raft know as Long Island and trying the bagles around to see which ones meet our standards. We compile our own data and have created a comprehensive system of rating each bagel and bagel shop. We rope more shmucks whenever possible because more data and more input is always better for science.
